           <h2><span>Missile</span> Man of India</h2>
           <p>
               <b><span>Aual Pakir Jaimulabdeen</span> Abdul Kalam</b>15 October 1931-27 July
               2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
               president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
               Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
               engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
               science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
               Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
               Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
               space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
               came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
               development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
               technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
               technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
               1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
