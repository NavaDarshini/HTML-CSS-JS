       <p>Another ambitious initiative, the <b>“Green Rameswaram Project”</b>, a joint venture with Vivekananda Kendra aims to transform Rameswaram. It was well appreciated, wherein the participation of all stakeholders including the government machinery, the citizens and the corporate houses has been mobilized. The significance of this project was well acknowledged by Dr. Abdul Kalam and he made his presence felt at the inauguration in 2014. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi was all praises for the initiative in his inaugural address. The project is the need of the hour as Rameswaram is both a pilgrim and a tourist spot. Hence it is absolutely necessary to have access to water facilities, waste management and beautification of the place. Renewable energy has to be explored for a clean environment. One of the prized possessions of Rameswaram is the marine biodiversity. We want to preserve the Marine life which is as significant as the people of Rameswaram to have a healthy life in a clean environment.</p>

        <h3 class="align-items-center">2.CENTRE FOR IGNITING MINDS</h3>
        <p>Triggers a multitude of emotions in every citizen of this country. where the heart swells with pride. An epitome of hard work. dedication and humility. he preached what he practiced. He inspired a whole generation. overcoming his financial instabilities at a young age fighting against all odds to reach the zenith of success. He left no stone unturned paving ways for a successful scientific career.<br>

            His vision. his dream. his hope. revolved around the youth of this country. He stressed the importance of moulding India’s future generations and he entrusted the role to the parents and teachers.<br>
            
            Throughout his lifetime. he motivated students to gain knowledge and succeed, brushing aside the fears of failure. He strongly believed that the knowledge acquired should translate into actions for prosperity. This is exactly the reason why he created the spark in student minds and specifically channelised them into the world of Science. The Centre for Igniting Minds works towards carrying for way legacy of Dr. Kalam. Inspiring children to analyse the aspects of science. encouraging to think logically and providing hands on experience is definitely a game changer. The scientific knowledge should be in sync with what is happening in nature and should not be in away that would antagonize the safety of our environment. Sensitizing this generation about the conservation of environment is also the need of the hour. They should realise the importance of preserving in the present. to remain prosperous in the future.<br>
            
            His enthusiasm in shaping young minds during his old age was truly remarkable! The confidence he exuberates. makes us shed our inhibitions and come out of our cocoons to face the wor Id. The path to success might be a tough one, but his positive attitude towards life are like petals strewn all over the path. His idea was to work on the overall refinement of our self and to be psychologically strong to lead our beloved country to prosperity.</p>

        <h3 class="">3. SCIENCE INNOVATION CENTRE</h3>
       <p>The Innovation Centre will be the space to promote & Educate the ideas of innovation ingenuity & creativity in students & teachers of schools.<br>

        Teaching and learning has changed significantly in recent years. Wireless Internet access, coupled with student and teacher access to technology all day, every day has been a part of this change. Today, the average Indian is able to easily find facts, figures, calculations, etc. through a few taps on Phone via a Google search. Thus, the need for memorization of facts, figures, and details, etc. has been replaced with the need for deep understanding, connection of ideas, and the ability to apply and transfer ideas to other areas.<br>
        
        Students of today must be trained in these need areas and are challenged to develop strategies to collaborate, brainstorm, research, and problem-solve. A dramatic paradigm shift in the role of educators has occurred, moving away from delivery of content to facilitation of deep understanding and synthesis of information for students.<br>
        
        Learning expectations involving higher levels of thinking, research, problem-solving, real- world application of learning, and critical thinking, which at one time were reserved for students at the collegiate level, are now expected of our secondary students. We are grooming Collaborators (who will be able to maximize interaction with others to problem-solve), Iterators (who will generate and refine ideas), Researchers (who will compile and use authentic data), and Creators (who will be able to integrate ideas and bring ideas to life). The Mini Science & Innovation Center will support these efforts, providing the space for progressive approaches to teaching and learning to thrive.<br></p>
        
        <p class="span">The center provides a student-centered learning environment with space for a variety of student experiences including:</p>
        <ul class="list">
        <li>Project - based learning</li>
        <li>Community partnerships</li>
        <li>High - level problem solving</li>
        <li>Innovative collaborative learning</li>
        <li>Cutting - edge technology</li>
        </ul>
